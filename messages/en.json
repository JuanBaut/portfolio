    "about": "<p>Born and based in Colombia. I believe in designing things with passion to solve problems with usability and aesthetics in mind. I speak C1 English and native Spanish.</p><p>I am a Neovim fan; I love to work with <ts>TypeScript</ts> and <tw>Tailwind</tw> on the front end, with <py>Python</py> or <go>Go</go> on the back end, and the terminal is my best friend.</p><p>Computers have always been my main interest, from customizing them to building them. There is something about having artistic control over a computer that I enjoy a lot. I also make music for fun and post it on my <sc>SoundCloud</sc>. These days, I try to keep myself active by skateboarding, because to no one's surprise, as a developer I spend too much time in a chair. </p><p> Feel free to reach out to me via <tt>Twitter</tt> or <li>LinkedIn</li> if you wish to collaborate or talk! </p>"
