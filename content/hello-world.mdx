### This MDX thing is fabulous!

Adding content is no longer a hassle and I have been wanting to have a blog
where I record some of my thoughts for myself and everyone interested. I must
admit I don't really know where having a blog could take me, but I like the
idea!

For anybody looking at this entry of the blog (the first one), you must know
this is version 3 of my portfolio! I know, perhaps writing from scratch a
portfolio for the third time isn't quite the amazing project. But I do not care
as long as I can keep the main entry point to my skills clean and updated. I
tend to share my portfolio to a lot to recruiters, and the impact it has, is
something I can't really grasp, so I'd rather have something polished to share.

### What's new?

In v1 I initially had the photos page, that I eventually removed in v2. This
time I brought it back, I think it gives more personality to the website, I get
it... there is a lot of amateur photographers (that happen to also be
programmers, interesting overlap...) with the same idea but, like everything in
life, execution is what matters.

Back in v2 I used a less uniform layout with some animations. This time we have
the opposite; a very uniform layout, for the sake of simplicity and tidiness,
and less layout animations. I think the animations were ok in the last version,
but this time I wanted to tone it down a bit and try different stuff, like text
animations instead of the viewport ones. 

Of course the addition of this blog, perhaps the greatest addition in this
version. With the MDX parser that allows me to put out content in a very simple
way.

### Things that didn't change.

I love shadcn/ui even if I only get to use it for one component. Why? It's
simple, it's not a package. And yes I get that it installs radix/ui packages
but it is very modular so your project only has the UI components/packages you
really need. Of course the customization and speed of setup are things I also
value a lot.

Tailwind just got updated to V4.0! And of course it had to be here too. For my
personal projects I find Tailwind a non-negotiable. The developer ergonomics
over vanilla CSS are huge, and the design standards also help a lot with making
things look good quickly.

Of course Next.js is still here. Mostly for the ease of deployment. I think it
is a heavy handed approach for a portfolio, but I can't deny it helps you setup
a lot of things quickly due to its ecosystem.

### What's next? And conclusions.

I can't deny that as of today I need to move on from this portfolio project
ASAP, so I can continue to work on other projects that will add more to my
resume than just the simplest front end skills haha. I might come back and fix
and tweak some stuff here and there, mostly because I want the portfolio to be
more impressive aesthetically, to kick harder so to speak, perhaps with the
addition of some animations or small design elements I could achive that. And
the last checkbox to mark; make the project section more descritive and
interesting.

That's it for now. Thank you for reading! I hope I will make more posts about
interesting things, like terminals, new tech, frameworks, and what not!
