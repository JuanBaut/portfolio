### This MDX Thing Is Fabulous!

Adding content is no longer a hassle, and I have been wanting to have a blog
where I can record some of my thoughts for myself and everyone interested. I
must admit I don't really know where having a blog could take me, but I like
the idea!

For anyone looking at this entry of the blog (the first one), you should know
that this is version 3 of my portfolio! I know, perhaps writing a portfolio
from scratch for the third time isn't exactly an amazing project. But I do not
care as long as I can keep the main entry point to my skills clean and updated.
I tend to share my portfolio with many recruiters, and the impact it has is
something I can't really grasp, so I'd rather have something polished to share.

### What's New?

In v1, I initially had a photos page that I eventually removed in v2. This
time, I brought it back because I think it gives more personality to the
website. I understand there are a lot of amateur photographers (who also happen
to be programmers, an interesting overlap) with the same idea, but like
everything in life, execution is what matters.

Back in v2, I used a less uniform layout with some animations. This time, we
have the opposite: a very uniform layout for the sake of simplicity and
tidiness, and fewer layout animations. I think the animations were okay in the
last version, but this time I wanted to tone them down a bit and try different
things, like text animations instead of viewport-based ones.

Of course, the addition of this blog is perhaps the greatest addition in this
version, thanks to the MDX parser that allows me to publish content in a very
simple way.

### Things That Didn't Change

I love shadcn/ui even if I only get to use it for one component. Why? It's
simple; it's not a monolithic package. And yes, I understand that it installs
Radix UI packages, but it is very modular, so your project only includes the UI
components/packages you really need. Of course, the customization and speed of
setup are things I also value a lot.

Tailwind just got updated to v4.0! And of course, it had to be included here
too. For my personal projects, I find Tailwind non-negotiable. The developer
ergonomics over vanilla CSS are huge, and the design standards also help a lot
with making things look good quickly.

Of course, Next.js is still here, mostly for the ease of deployment. I think it
is a heavy-handed approach for a portfolio, but I can't deny it helps you set
up many things quickly thanks to its ecosystem.

### What's Next? And Conclusions

I can't deny that as of today, I need to move on from this portfolio project
ASAP so I can continue to work on other projects that will add more to my
resume than just the simplest front-end skills haha. I might come back and fix
or tweak some stuff here and there, mostly because I want the portfolio to be
more impressive aesthetically, to kick harder so to speak, perhaps with the
addition of some animations or small design elements to achieve that. And the
last checkbox to mark: make the project section more descriptive and
interesting.

That's it for now. Thank you for reading! I hope to make more posts about
interesting things, like terminals, new tech, frameworks, and whatnot!
